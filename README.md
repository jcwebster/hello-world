# hello-world
This is my first repository. TIME TO LEARN HOW TO USE GITHUB.

Hey this is pretty cool. I didn't know Github had its own editor... I'm learning stuff already.

Watch me... before Christmas, I'll have a website up and running.

Memory really does fade after just 2 days... I've already forgotten how to push/pull and update appropriately.
