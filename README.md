# hello-world
This is my first repository. TIME TO LEARN HOW TO USE GITHUB.

Hey this is pretty cool. I didn't know Github had its own editor... I'm learning stuff already.

Already, I see MASSIVE potential for this for my resumes... I have about 100 copies saved on my computer in different folders right now.
