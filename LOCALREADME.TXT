Well, not sure how to save changes yet...
This is written locally on my laptop.
Next step (not committing)(not quitting); save in vim.

YES I DID IT. :)

Iâ€™ve got to keep this up in order to remember how to do it, until it becomes routine. Luckily, I can feel myself learning it.

Time to start working on my site!
